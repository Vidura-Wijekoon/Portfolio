									<h4>Himashi Dissanayake-Undergraduate | BSc in IT</h4>
									<p>I’ve known Vidura Wijekoon for a long time and he is a talented person, who brings all of the skills and expertise in IT, Programming, Mathematics, Public speech and all other freelance tasks. I’ve assigned many tasks for him and he completed all the tasks on time. His capability to complete tasks within a very short time was quite impressive. Vidura is an ambitious and enthusiastic person who is willing to learn new technologies. I am sure that he is confident in whatever he is assigned to. As a friend, Vidura earns my highest recommendation.</p>
							
									<h4>Vinuri Wijekoon-Undergraduate|Bsc(Hons)Information Technology|at SLIIT</h4>
									<p>A self-motivated and committed individual who highly applies his effort towards the success of the task. Vidura is very pleasant and reliable in his work..</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Kavindu Prabashwara Bogahwaththa |Official Expansion Vice President - Marketing & Digital Experience || AIESEC in University of Ruhuna</h4>
									<p>Vidura is a proactive, dedicated, and highly motivated engineering undergraduate. He is following the BSc Engineering degree with me at the faculty of Engineering University of Ruhuna. Since his very positive attitude towards work & efficiently working to succeed, I certainly would recommend him as a highly qualified future Engineer. </p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Anil Vithanage |Certified Educator at National Geographic Education</h4>
									<p>vidura was one of the best students in our school who had shown his wonderful tallents and potentials during his school life. He had the ability to think beyond what he sees and take action with similar type of students as a team to solve any kind of problem that they face. I am sure that he will use those qualities for his future endeavors and become a specific personality among the others in our society . .</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>kelum samarasena-Undergraduate | Independent Education Management Professional</h4>
									<p>Solidity is his forte .Vidura appears to take in things deeply before he takes up a task.He is one who refuses to rush in to a task unless he has got the grasp of things first hand. This is a rare quality in a young person, when its the norm to take chances and accept a degree of risk as part of the process.</p>
